# Mixtape Project

My example is not supposed to be a finished work of art. Learn more CSS to make your mixtape site look better than this!

## TO DO:
- In Atom, create an index.html doc then type HTML and hit tab to generate some code
- Upload to your Mixtape Repo
- Create a GitHub Page (see below) and add your link in About section
- Add an ordered list
- Add jump links
- Link to top
- Add CSS as we learn colors, backgrounds, and typography
- Add "album cover" to the header
- Add media/videos/links for more interest

## What else should you do?
(Just because you can doesn't mean you should!)

## How to edit your HTML:
- To edit an HTML document, right click it and "Open with" Atom or Visual Studio Code
- To view your website in the browser on your computer, double click the HTML file.

## GitHub Pages
After commiting your work to GitHub, you can see it online! As long as your have an index.html, you can have your webpage hosted for free here on GitHub.
- Go to "Settings" and scroll down until you see GitHub Pages.
- Choose the source (Branch) you want to see online.
- Click save.
It might take up to 10 or 20 minutes to activate. Once it is activated, your link will apear and you can click on it.
When you have your website link, or webpage address, add it to your README for easy access and so I can see it.
The link is public and anyone can see it. You can show friends your website!
