# Mixtape-1

My example is not supposed to be a finished work of art. Learn more CSS to make your mixtape site look better than this!

Bare bone code examples for students.
- Add a header
- Create a GitHub Page and add link in About section
- Add an ordered list
- Add jump links
- Link to top
- Add CSS as we learn colors, backgrounds, and typography
- Add "albumn cover"
- Add media/videos/links for more interest

What else should you do?
(Just because you can doesn't mean you should!)
